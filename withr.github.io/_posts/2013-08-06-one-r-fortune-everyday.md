Just found this interesting package [fortunes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/index.html) though it have been built for 9 years! I wrote a simple <a href="http://spark.rstudio.com/withr/Rfortunes/" target="_blank"> application</a> and deployed it on Rstudio server, So you can read those wisdom where you have internet connection.
  
Source code can be downloaded [here](https://gist.github.com/withr/d17fe7d161514fed287f).
