I bought a domain name from Godaddy long time ago. I thought to configure a domain name will take some time, that's the excuse why I didn't use it until now (shame on me).  Now I have to link my server to the domain name, and I found it's very easy. So I post the steps here, in case I need it in future. 

Two steps in short: **add DigitalOcean domain servers to the domain name (you bought) on Godaddy, and add domain name (you bought) to your droplet on DigitalOcean**.

### 1. Add DigitalOcean domain servers to Godaddy


Log onto your Godaddy account, and choose the domain name you want to link to your DigitalOcean droplet. Choose "Manage" of **Nameservers**.

Add DigitalOcean domain servers as shown in following picture.
