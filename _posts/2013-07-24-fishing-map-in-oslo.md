This year, I fell in love with fly fishing. Lucky for me, there are a lot of nice places for fishing in Oslo forest. There is website called [OFA](http://ofa.no/) listed what kind of fishes and their population density in many lakes. I scripped the data and displayed them on Google Map, so it's more intuitive and convenient to plan the route. 



This is the [map](/misc/FiskeiMarka.html), and you can download the source code [here](/misc/FiskeiMarka.R).
